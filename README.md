## Quick Start Guide

### Pre-requisites
For compatibility, it’s recommended to use a virtual environment with Python 3.10. Follow these steps to set it up:
```shell
python3.10 -m venv sciborg-env
source sciborg-env/bin/activate
```

### Installation
To install the SciBORG agent, clone the repository and install the dependencies using the following commands:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/chopralab/sciborg.git
cd sciborg
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Testing the Installation
Test the installation by running the following command:
```python
import os
os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = "<YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>"

import sys
sys.path.insert(1, "path to the parent of this folder") 

from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from sciborg.ai.agents.core import create_linqx_chat_agent
from sciborg.ai.chains.microservice import module_to_microservice
from sciborg.ai.chains.workflow import create_workflow_planner_chain, create_workflow_constructor_chain

from sciborg.testing.models.drivers import MicrowaveSynthesizer, MicrowaveSynthesizerObject, PubChemCaller
from sciborg.core.library.base import BaseDriverMicroservice
```
If the above command runs without any errors, the installation was successful and the SciBORG agent is ready to use.

### Directory Structure
If the installation was successful, the directory structure should look like this:
```
sciborg/
  ai/
  core/
  embeddings/
  LCU/
  lcu-remote-client/
  microservices/
  notebooks/
  testing/
  utils/
  README.md
  requirements.txt
```

#### Directory Structure Explanation:

- `ai/`: Contains implementations of various AI agents that drive SciBORG’s functionality, including the RAG agent and other pre-built agents.
- `core/`: The core logic and infrastructure that powers SciBORG, including utilities for agent management, execution, and task orchestration.
- `embeddings/`: Stores models and logic for generating and managing document embeddings. This folder is essential for supporting tasks like document similarity and context retrieval.
- `microservices/`: Houses microservices that enable SciBORG to interact with other applications, databases, and APIs, facilitating the broader applicability of the agents.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks providing tutorials, demos, and examples for using SciBORG agents. This folder is highly recommended for new users to understand SciBORG’s capabilities.
- `testing/`: Test cases and scripts to verify the accuracy, reliability, and performance of each component and agent within SciBORG.
- `utils/`: Utility scripts and helper functions that support various tasks across SciBORG, like benchmarking.

## Creating Agents

### Making the microservice for the agents
#### Microwave Synthesizer microservice
```python
file_path = 'path_to_json/driver_MicroSynth.json'

driver_command_microservice = module_to_microservice(MicrowaveSynthesizer)

with open(file_path, 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(driver_command_microservice.model_dump_json(indent=2))
```
#### PubChem microservice
```python
file_path = 'path_to_json/driver_pubchem.json'

pubchem_command_microservice = module_to_microservice(PubChemCaller)

with open(file_path, 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(pubchem_command_microservice.model_dump_json(indent=2))
```

### RAG Agent

The RAG Agent (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is used for answering scientific questions based on provided context. To use the RAG agent, run the following command:

```python
rag_agent = create_linqx_chat_agent(
    microservice=driver_command_microservice,
    rag_vectordb_path = '<path>/embeddings/NIH_docs_embeddings',
    llm=ChatOpenAI(model='gpt-4'),
    human_interaction=False,
    verbose=True
)
```

### Pubchem Agent
```python
pubchem_agent = create_linqx_chat_agent(
    microservice=pubchem_command_microservice,
    llm=ChatOpenAI(model='gpt-4'),
    human_interaction=False,
    verbose=True
)
```

### PubChem and RAG Agent
```python
pubchem_and_rag_agent = create_linqx_chat_agent(
    microservice=pubchem_command_microservice,
    rag_vectordb_path = '<path>/embeddings/NIH_docs_embeddings',
    llm=ChatOpenAI(model='gpt-4'),
    human_interaction=False,
    verbose=True
)
```

What do these paramaters mean?
- `microservice`: The microservice that the agent will use to interact with external services or APIs.
- `rag_vectordb_path`: The path to the document embeddings used by the RAG agent for context retrieval.
- `llm`: The language model used by the agent for generating responses. In this case, it’s the GPT-4 model.
- `human_interaction`: A boolean flag to enable or disable human interaction with the agent.

For detailed demonstrations and examples, refer to the Jupyter notebooks `notebooks/SI/SI_traces_01.ipynb` and `notebooks/SI/SI_traces_02.ipynb` in the repository.
Task: link the folder to the notebooks

## Benchmarking the Agents

SciBORG includes benchmarking scripts to evaluate the performance of each agent. There are three ways to benchmark the agents:
- State Based Benchmarking
- Path Based Benchmarking
- RegEx Based Benchmarking

For additional details on benchmarking and usage, refer to the `notebooks/SI/SI_benchmarks_01.ipynb`, `notebooks/SI/SI_benchmarks_02.ipynb` and `notebooks/SI/SI_benchmarks_03.ipynb` notebooks.
Task: link the folder to the notebooks
